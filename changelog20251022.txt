Tyros5 MIDI Integrator - Complete GarageBand Redesign

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Complete visual redesign of the entire application to match Apple's GarageBand 
for iPad aesthetic. This was a comprehensive overhaul of the design system, 
replacing the previous orange/amber theme with GarageBand's signature blue 
color scheme, improving contrast and readability, and adding premium visual 
effects throughout the interface.

Key Changes:
• Complete color system overhaul from orange/amber to iOS blue (#007AFF)
• Improved text contrast and readability with white/light gray text
• Added premium visual effects (shadows, gradients, glass morphism)
• Fixed configuration defaults (mixer: vertical, voice nav: category)
• Optimized iPad horizontal mixer with smaller knobs but readable text
• Systematically removed all orange/amber colors from every component
• Enhanced overall visual polish and professional appearance
